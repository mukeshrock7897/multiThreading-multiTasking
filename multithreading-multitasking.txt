1. What is Multithreading in Python?

Multithreading in Python is a technique that allows you to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process
This can improve the performance of your program, especially for tasks that involve I/O operations or that can be broken down into independent subtasks
Python provides the threading module to work with multithreading

2. Types of Multithreading and Approaches

- Threading Module: The threading module in Python is a high-level interface for creating and managing threads. It provides classes and functions to create threads, control their execution, and synchronize their access to shared resources. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), it may not be the most efficient choice for CPU-bound tasks, as only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time.

- Multiprocessing Module: The multiprocessing module in Python is a high-level interface for creating and managing processes. It provides classes and functions to spawn processes, communicate between them, and synchronize their access to shared resources. Unlike the threading module, multiprocessing can bypass the GIL by creating separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space, enabling true parallelism. This makes it more effective for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from multiple cores or processors.

- Asyncio: asyncio is an asynchronous I/O framework in Python that provides a way to write concurrent code without using traditional threads. It uses an event loop to manage asynchronous tasks, allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking each other. This makes it particularly effective for I/O-bound tasks, such as network requests or file operations, where the program is often waiting for external events. While asyncio doesn't use true multithreading, it can achieve similar results by efficiently managing asynchronous operations, avoiding the overhead of thread creation and context switching.


To understand these approaches, it's important first to discuss the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

=================================================
-------------------------------------------------

Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):
GIL is a mechanism in Python that prevents multiple threads(only one thread can execute Python code at a time) from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously within a single process. 
This can limit performance for CPU-bound tasks, but has less impact on I/O-bound tasks(GIL does not affect I/O-bound tasks as much).
The GIL can be a significant bottleneck for CPU-bound tasks, where the program's performance is limited by the CPU

Example: Effect of GIL on CPU-bound Task

import threading
import time

# A CPU-bound task that doesn't involve I/O operations
def cpu_bound_task(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i**2
    return total

# Wrapper function for threading
def thread_task(n):
    cpu_bound_task(n)
    
# Number of iterations
n = 10**7

# Single-threaded execution
start_time = time.time()
cpu_bound_task(n)
cpu_bound_task(n)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Single-threaded execution time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

# Multi-threaded execution
start_time = time.time()
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=thread_task, args=(n,))
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=thread_task, args=(n,))

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Multi-threaded execution time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

Output:
Single-threaded execution time: 10.30 seconds
Multi-threaded execution time: 7.15 seconds

Explanation:
* CPU-bound Task: The cpu_bound_task function performs a computation-intensive task, which sums the squares of numbers from 0 to n. This task is purely CPU-bound and doesn't involve I/O operations.
* Single-threaded Execution: The task is executed twice sequentially, and the time taken is measured.
* Multi-threaded Execution: The same task is executed in two separate threads. Because of the GIL, both threads cannot execute Python bytecode simultaneously on a multi-core CPU, which means they don't truly run in parallel.


=================================================
-------------------------------------------------

1. Threading Module

The `threading` module in Python provides a way to create and manage threads. Despite the GIL, threading is useful for I/O-bound tasks where the program is waiting for network responses, file I/O, or other external resources.

#### Example Code:
import threading
import time

def task(name):
    print(f"Thread {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {name} finished")

# Create two threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=task, args=("One",))
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=task, args=("Two",))

# Start the threads
t1= time.perf_counter()
thread1.start()
thread2.start()
t2= time.perf_counter()

# Wait for both threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
print(f"total executions time are {t2-t1}")

print("Both threads have finished execution.")

Output:
Thread One starting
Thread Two starting
Thread One finished
Thread Two finished
total executions time are 0.011744869999915863
Both threads have finished execution.

#### Use Cases:
- **I/O-bound tasks**: When your program needs to wait for external resources like web servers, file systems, or databases.
- **GUI applications**: To keep the user interface responsive while performing background operations.

=================================================
-------------------------------------------------

### 2. Multiprocessing Module

The `multiprocessing` module is used to bypass the GIL by creating separate processes. Each process runs independently with its own Python interpreter and memory space, enabling true parallelism. This is more effective for CPU-bound tasks.

#### Example Code:

import multiprocessing
import time

def task(name):
    print(f"Process {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Process {name} finished")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create two processes
    process1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=task, args=("One",))
    process2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=task, args=("Two",))

    # Start the processes
    t1= time.perf_counter()
    process1.start()
    process2.start()

    # Wait for both processes to complete
    process1.join()
    process2.join()
    t2= time.perf_counter()
    print(f"total executions time are {t2-t1}")

    print("Both processes have finished execution.")


Output:
Process One starting
Process Two starting
Process One finished
Process Two finished
total executions time are 2.0482301729998653
Both processes have finished execution.

#### Use Cases:
- **CPU-bound tasks**: For computationally intensive tasks like numerical computations, data processing, or image processing.
- **Parallel processing**: When you need to utilize multiple CPU cores effectively.

=================================================
-------------------------------------------------

### 3. Asyncio

`asyncio` is an asynchronous I/O framework that allows for concurrent code execution using an event loop. It doesn't involve traditional threads or processes but instead uses non-blocking I/O calls, which makes it very efficient for I/O-bound tasks.

#### Example Code:

import asyncio
import time

async def task(name):
    print(f"Task {name} starting")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print(f"Task {name} finished")

async def main():
    # Schedule two tasks to run concurrently
    await asyncio.gather(task("One"), task("Two"))

# Use this instead of asyncio.run() when in a running event loop
t1 = time.perf_counter()
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()  # Get the running event loop
loop.run_until_complete(main())  # Run the main function
t2 = time.perf_counter()

print(f"Total execution time is {t2 - t1:.2f} seconds")
print("All tasks have finished execution.")


Output:
Task One starting
Task Two starting
Task One finished
Task Two finished
Total execution time is 2.00 seconds
All tasks have finished execution.


#### Use Cases:
- **I/O-bound tasks**: When the program deals with a lot of network or file I/O operations, especially when handling many connections simultaneously.
- **Web scraping**: Efficiently handle multiple requests without blocking.
- **Real-time data processing**: Applications that require real-time data processing, like chat applications, servers, or message brokers.

=================================================
I- Thread Creation
-------------------------------------------------

1-threading.Thread(target=function, args=(), kwargs={}):
threading.Thread() is a high-level method provided by the threading module. It creates a new thread object, which can then be started using the .start() method. 
This method allows you to pass the target function to be executed by the thread, along with any positional (args) and keyword arguments (kwargs) that the function might require.

Use Case: 
Suitable when you need more control over the thread’s lifecycle, such as being able to start, stop, join, or monitor the thread. This method is ideal for most multithreading scenarios where you may need to manage the thread after its creation, such as waiting for it to finish or handling exceptions within the thread.

Example:
import threading
import time

def print_numbers(name, count):
    for i in range(1, count + 1):
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"{name} prints {i}")

# Create a new thread object
thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers, args=("Thread-1", 5))

# Start the thread
thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to complete
thread.join()

print("Main thread completed.")

Output:
Thread-1 prints 1
Thread-1 prints 2
Thread-1 prints 3
Thread-1 prints 4
Thread-1 prints 5
Main thread completed.

------------------------------------------------

2-threading.start_new_thread(function, args=()):
_thread.start_new_thread() is a low-level method provided by the _thread module (formerly known as thread). This function starts a new thread and immediately runs the target function. Unlike threading.Thread(), it doesn’t create a Thread object, which means there’s no direct way to join or manage the thread after it’s started.

Use Case: 
This method is useful for simple tasks where you don’t need to manage the thread after it starts, such as running a background task that doesn’t require monitoring or synchronization with the main thread. It’s a more lightweight approach compared to threading.Thread().

Example:
import _thread
import time

def print_numbers(name, count):
    for i in range(1, count + 1):
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"{name} prints {i}")

# Start a new thread using _thread.start_new_thread
_thread.start_new_thread(print_numbers, ("Thread-2", 5))

# Main thread continues to run
print("Main thread is free to do other work.")

# Adding sleep to keep the main thread alive
time.sleep(6)
print("Main thread completed.")


Output:
Main thread is free to do other work.
Thread-2 prints 1
Thread-2 prints 2
Thread-2 prints 3
Thread-2 prints 4
Thread-2 prints 5
Main thread completed.



=================================================
II- Thread Information
-------------------------------------------------

1- thread.start():

This method starts the thread's activity. It calls the run() method of the thread in a separate, new thread of control.
Once start() is called, the thread begins its execution independently and concurrently with other threads.

Example:
import threading

def task():
    print("Thread is running")

# Create a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=task)

# Start the thread
thread.start()


Output:
Thread is running

-------------------------------------------------

2- thread.join():

This method makes the calling thread (usually the main thread) wait for the thread on which join() is called to terminate.
It is often used to ensure that a thread has completed its work before proceeding with the next step in the main thread.

Example:

import threading

def task():
    print("Thread is running")

# Create a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=task)

# Start the thread
thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to finish
thread.join()
print("Thread has finished")



Output:
Thread is running
Thread has finished

-------------------------------------------------

3- thread.run():

This method contains the code that the thread will execute when it is started.
When you define a thread by subclassing Thread, you override the run() method with the code that you want the thread to execute.
You don't usually call run() directly; it's called by start(). If you call run() directly, it will execute in the current thread, not in a new thread.

Example:
import threading

class MyThread(threading.Thread):
    def run(self):
        print("Thread is running")

# Create a thread
thread = MyThread()

# Start the thread (which internally calls run())
thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to finish
thread.join()


Output:
Thread is running


=================================================
III- Thread Synchronization:
-------------------------------------------------

1. threading.Thread()
create a new thread

Use Case:
Creating a new thread to run a function in parallel with the main program. For example, downloading multiple files concurrently.

Example:

import threading
import time

def download_file(file_name):
    print(f"Starting download: {file_name}")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate download time
    print(f"Finished download: {file_name}")

# Creating threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=("file1.zip",))
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=("file2.zip",))

# Starting threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Waiting for threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("All downloads completed.")

=================================================
-------------------------------------------------

2. threading.Lock():
To synchronize threads using a lock, ensuring that only one thread executes a particular section of code at a time.

Use Case:
Managing access to a shared resource (e.g., a shared database or file) to prevent race conditions.

Example:
import threading

balance = 0
balance_lock = threading.Lock()

def deposit(amount):
    global balance
    with balance_lock:  # Ensure only one thread modifies the balance at a time
        local_balance = balance
        local_balance += amount
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay
        balance = local_balance
        print(f"Deposited {amount}, New balance: {balance}")

# Creating threads
threads = []
for i in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=deposit, args=(100,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Waiting for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(f"Final balance: {balance}")

Output:
Deposited 100, New balance: 100
Deposited 100, New balance: 200
Deposited 100, New balance: 300
Deposited 100, New balance: 400
Deposited 100, New balance: 500
Final balance: 500

=================================================
-------------------------------------------------


3. threading.RLock():
A re-entrant lock

Use Case:
Using a re-entrant lock when a thread might need to acquire the same lock multiple times. Useful in recursive functions.

Example:
import threading

lock = threading.RLock()

def recursive_task(n):
    with lock:
        if n > 0:
            print(f"Task {n} running")
            recursive_task(n - 1)

# Starting the task in a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=recursive_task, args=(5,))
thread.start()
thread.join()

print("Recursive task completed.")

Output:
Task 5 running
Task 4 running
Task 3 running
Task 2 running
Task 1 running
Recursive task completed

=================================================
-------------------------------------------------


4. threading.Condition():
A condition variable that can be used to wait for some condition to be met.

Use Case:
Synchronizing threads by making one or more threads wait until a specific condition is met, such as producer-consumer scenarios.

Example:
import threading

condition = threading.Condition()
items = []

def producer():
    with condition:
        for i in range(1, 6):
            items.append(i)
            print(f"Produced item {i}")
            condition.notify()  # Notify consumers that a new item is available
            time.sleep(1)

def consumer():
    with condition:
        while len(items) == 0:
            condition.wait()  # Wait until an item is produced
        item = items.pop(0)
        print(f"Consumed item {item}")

# Starting threads
producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)
consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer)

producer_thread.start()
consumer_thread.start()

producer_thread.join()
consumer_thread.join()

print("Production and consumption completed.")

Output:
Produced item 1
Produced item 2
Produced item 3
Produced item 4
Produced item 5
Consumed item 1
Production and consumption completed.


=================================================
-------------------------------------------------


5. threading.Event():
A simple event class to synchronize threads.

Use Case:
Signaling between threads, such as stopping a thread or waiting for an event to occur before proceeding.

Example:
import threading

event = threading.Event()

def task():
    print("Waiting for event to start...")
    event.wait()  # Wait for the event to be set
    print("Event occurred! Task running...")

# Starting the task in a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
thread.start()

time.sleep(3)  # Simulate delay
print("Setting event")
event.set()  # Trigger the event

thread.join()

print("Task completed.")

Output:
Waiting for event to start...
Setting event
Event occurred! Task running...
Task completed.


=================================================
-------------------------------------------------

6. threading.Semaphore():
To control access to a shared resource

Use Case:
Controlling access to a limited resource, like a connection pool where only a fixed number of connections are allowed simultaneously.

Example:
import threading
import time

semaphore = threading.Semaphore(2)  # Allow only 2 threads to access the resource

def access_resource(thread_num):
    print(f"Thread-{thread_num} waiting to access the resource...")
    with semaphore:
        print(f"Thread-{thread_num} accessing the resource")
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate resource usage
    print(f"Thread-{thread_num} released the resource")

# Starting threads
threads = []
for i in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=access_resource, args=(i,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print("All threads have completed.")

Output:
Thread-0 waiting to access the resource...
Thread-0 accessing the resource
Thread-1 waiting to access the resource...
Thread-1 accessing the resource
Thread-2 waiting to access the resource...
Thread-3 waiting to access the resource...
Thread-4 waiting to access the resource...
Thread-0 released the resourceThread-1 released the resource
Thread-3 accessing the resourceThread-2 accessing the resource


Thread-3 released the resourceThread-2 released the resource

Thread-4 accessing the resource
Thread-4 released the resource
All threads have completed.

=================================================
-------------------------------------------------

7. threading.Barrier():
To make threads wait until all have reached a certain point.

Use Case:
Synchronizing threads such that they all wait until each has reached a certain point before any can proceed. Useful in scenarios like parallel algorithms where all threads must complete one phase before moving to the next.

Example:
import threading

barrier = threading.Barrier(3)

def task(thread_num):
    print(f"Thread-{thread_num} is working...")
    time.sleep(thread_num)  # Simulate different workloads
    print(f"Thread-{thread_num} reached the barrier")
    barrier.wait()  # Wait until all threads reach this point
    print(f"Thread-{thread_num} proceeding after barrier")

# Starting threads
threads = []
for i in range(3):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=task, args=(i,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print("All threads have passed the barrier.")


Output:
Thread-0 is working...
Thread-1 is working...
Thread-0 reached the barrier
Thread-2 is working...
Thread-1 reached the barrier
Thread-2 reached the barrier
Thread-2 proceeding after barrierThread-0 proceeding after barrier

Thread-1 proceeding after barrier
All threads have passed the barrier.


=================================================
IV- Thread-Safe Data Structures:
-------------------------------------------------
1. threading.local():
threading.local() creates a thread-local storage object, which is a data structure where each thread can store data that is local to it.
Each thread that accesses the thread-local storage has its own separate copy of the data, preventing conflicts or data corruption.

Use Case:
Suppose you have a web server that processes multiple requests in parallel, and each request needs its own database connection. You can use threading.local() to store each thread's database connection independently, ensuring they don't interfere with each other.

Example:
import threading

# Create a thread-local storage object
local_data = threading.local()

def process_request():
    # Assign a unique value to the thread's local storage
    local_data.connection = f"Connection for {threading.current_thread().name}"
    print(local_data.connection)

# Create multiple threads
threads = []
for i in range(3):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=process_request)
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to finish
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()


Output:
Connection for Thread-42 (process_request)
Connection for Thread-43 (process_request)
Connection for Thread-44 (process_request)


-------------------------------------------------------
2. threading.Timer(interval, function, args=(), kwargs={}):
threading.Timer creates a timer that waits for a specified interval (in seconds) before executing a function.
It runs the function in a separate thread after the interval has passed, which is useful for scheduling tasks to run in the future.

Use Case:
Imagine a scenario where you want to send a reminder email to a user if they haven't responded within 30 minutes. You can use threading.Timer to delay the sending of the reminder.

Example:
import threading

def send_reminder(user):
    print(f"Sending reminder to {user}")

# Create a timer that sends a reminder after 30 seconds
timer = threading.Timer(30, send_reminder, args=("user@example.com",))
timer.start()

# The main thread continues to run and do other tasks
print("Main thread is doing other tasks...")

# Optionally, you can cancel the timer if the user responds
# timer.cancel()

Output:
Main thread is doing other tasks...
Sending reminder to user@example.com

=================================================
V- Other Functions:
-------------------------------------------------

1. threading.enumerate():
threading.enumerate() returns a list of all currently active Thread objects. This includes the main thread, and any threads that are still running, but not the ones that have terminated.

Use Case:
Useful when you want to inspect or manage

Example:
import threading
import time

def task():
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name} is running")

# Create and start multiple threads
for i in range(3):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
    thread.start()

# List all active threads
active_threads = threading.enumerate()
print("Active threads:", active_threads)

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in active_threads:
    if thread != threading.main_thread():  # Avoid joining the main thread
        thread.join()


Output:
Active threads: [<_MainThread(MainThread, started 133809349816320)>, <Thread(Thread-2 (_thread_main), started daemon 133809185629760)>, <Heartbeat(Thread-3, started daemon 133809102124608)>, <ParentPollerUnix(Thread-1, started daemon 133809062278720)>, <Thread(_colab_inspector_thread, started daemon 133808733009472)>, <Thread(Thread-46 (task), started 133808716224064)>, <Thread(Thread-47 (task), started 133809251022400)>, <Thread(Thread-48 (task), started 133808724616768)>]
Thread Thread-46 (task) is running
Thread Thread-47 (task) is running
Thread Thread-48 (task) is running

--------------------------------------------------
2. threading.activeCount():
threading.activeCount() (or threading.active_count() in newer versions of Python) returns the number of currently active threads. It is a simpler way to check how many threads are running without needing to retrieve the actual thread objects.

Use Case:
Useful when you want to know the count of active threads, such as monitoring the health of your application or deciding when to start new threads.

Example:
import threading
import time

def task():
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name} is running")

# Create and start multiple threads
for i in range(3):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
    thread.start()

# Print the number of active threads
print("Number of active threads:", threading.activeCount())


Output:
Number of active threads: 8
<ipython-input-23-cbef9805ea0b>:14: DeprecationWarning: activeCount() is deprecated, use active_count() instead
  print("Number of active threads:", threading.activeCount())

------------------------------------------------------------
3. threading.main_thread():
threading.main_thread() returns the Thread object representing the main thread of the program. The main thread is the thread in which the Python interpreter itself is running, and it's where your program begins execution.

Use Case:
Useful when you need to differentiate between the main thread and other threads, such as ensuring certain actions are only performed in the main thread.

Example:
import threading

def task():
    print(f"Running in: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Get the main thread
main_thread = threading.main_thread()
print(f"Main thread: {main_thread.name}")

# Start a new thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
thread.start()

# Check if current thread is the main thread
if threading.current_thread() == main_thread:
    print("This is the main thread.")

# Wait for the new thread to finish
thread.join()

Output:
Main thread: MainThread
Running in: Thread-52 (task)
This is the main thread




### 4. Why Use Multithreading? Real-Time Use Case

Multithreading is used to improve the performance of programs by allowing them to perform multiple tasks concurrently. However, due to the GIL, multithreading in Python is more effective for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks.

**Real-Time Use Case**:
- **Web Servers**: A web server might need to handle multiple client requests simultaneously. Each request could be processed in a separate thread, allowing the server to handle multiple connections at once. In this case, the GIL is not a significant issue because most of the work involves I/O operations (like waiting for a response from a database).

### 5. How to Implement Multithreading in Python

Here’s a simple example of implementing multithreading in Python using the `threading` module:

```python
import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Number: {i}")
        time.sleep(1)

def print_letters():
    for letter in "ABCDE":
        print(f"Letter: {letter}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Creating threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Starting threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for both threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Finished!")
```

In this example, `print_numbers` and `print_letters` are executed concurrently in separate threads. This works well for I/O-bound tasks, but for CPU-bound tasks, the GIL might prevent any significant performance improvement.

### 6. Real-Time Industry Use of Multithreading

- **Web Servers**: Handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Database Servers**: Processing concurrent queries.
- **GUIs**: Handling user interactions while performing background tasks.
- **Network Applications**: Downloading multiple files at the same time.

### 7. Advantages and Disadvantages of Multithreading

**Advantages**:
- **Improved Performance**: Particularly in I/O-bound tasks where threads can run concurrently.
- **Responsiveness**: Applications remain responsive, for example, GUIs that continue to respond to user input while performing tasks in the background.
- **Resource Sharing**: Threads within the same process can easily share resources like memory.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Complexity**: Writing, debugging, and maintaining multithreaded code can be challenging.
- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: In Python, the GIL prevents true parallel execution of threads in CPU-bound tasks, limiting the effectiveness of multithreading. This makes Python multithreading less suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require significant processing power.
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Frequent context switching between threads can lead to performance degradation.
- **Synchronization Issues**: Improper synchronization can lead to issues like deadlocks and race conditions.

The GIL is a critical consideration when deciding whether to use multithreading in Python, especially for CPU-bound tasks. For such tasks, alternatives like multiprocessing or using other programming languages that do not have a GIL might be more effective.
