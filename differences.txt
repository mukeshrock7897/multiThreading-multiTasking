Differences

1-Context:

Multitasking: Manages execution of multiple tasks at OS level (can be process or thread based).
Multithreading: Manages multiple threads within a single process (efficient communication but limited parallelism in Python).
Multiprocessing: Runs multiple processes in parallel (each with independent memory) for CPU-bound tasks.
Multiprogramming: Runs multiple independent programs by switching between them to maximize CPU utilization.
Asyncio: Runs multiple tasks concurrently within a single thread (ideal for I/O-bound operations).

2-Concurrency vs. Parallelism:

Multitasking: Provides concurrency (or parallelism if process-based).
Multithreading: Provides concurrency (parallelism limited by Python’s GIL).
Multiprocessing: Provides true parallelism (uses multiple CPU cores).
Multiprogramming: Provides concurrency (by switching between programs, no parallelism).
Asyncio: Provides concurrency (non-blocking, cooperative multitasking, no parallelism).

3-Use Cases:

Multitasking: General-purpose, running multiple applications (I/O- or CPU-bound).
Multithreading: I/O-bound tasks (networking, file I/O) where threads can run independently.
Multiprocessing: CPU-bound tasks (data processing, heavy computations).
Multiprogramming: Maximizing CPU usage by switching between multiple programs.
Asyncio: I/O-bound tasks that benefit from non-blocking execution (e.g., web servers, network operations).

4-Resource Sharing:

Multitasking: Varies (processes don’t share resources; threads do).
Multithreading: Threads share memory/resources.
Multiprocessing: Processes do not share memory; need IPC for communication.
Multiprogramming: Programs are isolated, but may share system resources like memory.
Asyncio: Tasks share memory and resources, as they run in a single thread.

5-Parallelism:

Multitasking: Can achieve parallelism (if process-based).
Multithreading: Concurrency only (in Python due to GIL), no parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.
Multiprocessing: True parallelism.
Multiprogramming: Concurrency, not parallelism.
Asyncio: Concurrency, no parallelism (cooperative multitasking).
