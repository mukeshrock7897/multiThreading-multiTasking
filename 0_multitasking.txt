Multitasking:
=====================
Multitasking in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This can be achieved through various forms of concurrency and parallelism
This can be achieved through two primary mechanisms
1-Thread based multitasking
2-Process Based multitasking

============================
1-Thread Based multitasking
----------------------------

1- What is Thread-Based Multitasking?
========================================

- Thread-based multitasking is a form of multitasking where multiple threads are used to execute different tasks concurrently within a single process. Threads are lighter than processes and share the same memory space. Each thread runs independently, enabling multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same program. This is useful when you want to perform multiple operations simultaneously, like handling user input while performing background tasks.
- Thread Based multitasking also known as multithreading


In thread-based multitasking:
- Each thread runs independently of others, though they share the same resources (memory, file handles).
- Threading is commonly used in scenarios like web servers, GUI applications, and parallel computations.

2. Thread-Based Multitasking Approaches
=========================================

There are two common approaches to thread-based multitasking:

- Pre-emptive Multitasking: The operating system controls thread scheduling, switching between threads based on certain conditions like time slices. Threads are interrupted to ensure fair CPU time distribution.
  - Example: Most operating systems use pre-emptive multitasking to manage processes and threads.

- Cooperative Multitasking: Threads voluntarily yield control of the CPU to allow other threads to run. Threads must explicitly yield control, and they cooperate to manage multitasking.
  - Example: In some event-driven systems, like certain UI frameworks, threads yield when waiting for user input.

3. Built-in Functions for Thread-Based Multitasking
=====================================================
Python provides a `threading` module that facilitates thread-based multitasking. Some of the commonly used functions include:

- `threading.Thread(target, args)`: Creates a new thread that executes the specified `target` function with the given `args`.
  
- `threading.start()`: Starts the thread’s execution.
  
- `threading.join()`: Blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` is called finishes execution.
  
- `threading.enumerate()`: Returns a list of all currently active threads.
  
- `threading.activeCount()`: Returns the number of currently active threads.
  
- `threading.Lock()`: A lock object to ensure that only one thread at a time can access a particular section of the code.

4. Real-Time Use Case
=======================
A common real-time use case for thread-based multitasking is a web server. A web server needs to handle multiple user requests at the same time. Each request (such as loading a webpage) can be handled by a separate thread. This allows the server to manage thousands of users simultaneously.

import threading
import time

def handle_request(request_id):
    print(f"Handling request {request_id}")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating I/O operation
    print(f"Finished request {request_id}")

# Create and start threads to handle multiple requests
for i in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_request, args=(i,))
    thread.start()

In this example, each web request is handled by a separate thread, allowing multiple requests to be processed concurrently.

5. Implementations
=========================

import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Number: {i}")
        time.sleep(1)

def print_letters():
    for letter in "abcde":
        print(f"Letter: {letter}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Create threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Start threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for both threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Both threads have finished")

Output:
Number: 1
Letter: a
Number: 2
Letter: b
Number: 3
Letter: c
Number: 4
Letter: d
Number: 5
Letter: e
Both threads have finished


In this implementation:
- Two threads are created: one for printing numbers and another for printing letters.
- They run concurrently and independently of each other.

6. Advantages and Disadvantages
==================================

Advantages:
============
1. Efficient Resource Sharing: Threads share the same memory space, so they can communicate more efficiently than separate processes.
2. Low Overhead: Threads are lighter than processes and have lower overhead since they share resources.
3. Concurrency: Multiple threads can run concurrently, improving responsiveness. For example, in GUI applications, you can handle background tasks while keeping the interface responsive.
4. Parallelism: Threads can be executed on multiple cores, leading to better performance for CPU-bound tasks in systems with multiple cores.

Disadvantages:
===============
1. Complexity: Managing multiple threads can make the program more complex and harder to debug due to race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization issues.
2. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In Python, the GIL prevents true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks because only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. This limits the performance benefit of multi-threading for CPU-intensive operations.
3. Data Corruption: Since threads share the same memory, improper synchronization (e.g., using locks) can lead to data corruption or inconsistent state if multiple threads access shared data simultaneously.
4. Overhead of Context Switching: Switching between threads requires context switching, which can be costly if overdone.



============================
2-Process Based multitasking
----------------------------

1- Process-Based Multitasking
==============================
- Process-based multitasking is a technique where multiple processes run concurrently, with each process having its own memory space and resources. Unlike threads, processes do not share memory directly, and communication between them typically occurs via inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, message queues, or shared memory.
-  Process based multitasking as known as multiprocessing 
- Process-based multitasking allows for true parallelism and is suited for CPU-bound tasks that require isolation and intensive computation
- Python provides a multiprocessing module to handle process-based multitasking

Example:
=========

import multiprocessing
import time

# Define a function to be executed in a separate process
def task(task_id):
    print(f"Task {task_id} is starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a long-running task
    print(f"Task {task_id} is completed")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create multiple processes
    processes = []
    for i in range(5):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=task, args=(i,))
        processes.append(process)
    
    # Start all processes
    for process in processes:
        process.start()
    
    # Wait for all processes to finish
    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    print("All tasks are completed.")

Output:
Task 0 is startingTask 1 is starting

Task 2 is starting
Task 3 is starting
Task 4 is starting
Task 1 is completedTask 0 is completed

Task 2 is completed
Task 3 is completed
Task 4 is completed
All tasks are completed.

Explanation of Example:
=======================
i- Define the task function:
The task() function represents the unit of work you want to run in each process. Each process will execute this function independently.

ii- Creating processes:
Inside the if __name__ == '__main__': block, you create multiple Process objects using multiprocessing.Process(). Each process runs the task() function with a different argument.

iii- Starting processes:
The start() method launches each process, running them in parallel. Each process operates independently, with its own memory and CPU execution path.

iv- Joining processes:
The join() method ensures that the main program waits for all processes to finish before continuing. Without this, the main process might finish while child processes are still running.


2. Process Communication Pattern
==================================
When working with processes, you often need to pass data between them. Python’s multiprocessing module provides several IPC mechanisms, such as Queue or Pipe. Here’s an example using a Queue for communication between processes

Example:
=========

import multiprocessing
import time

# Define a worker function that sends results back via a Queue
def worker(task_id, queue):
    print(f"Task {task_id} is starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate work
    result = f"Task {task_id} result"
    queue.put(result)  # Put result in queue
    print(f"Task {task_id} is completed")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a Queue for inter-process communication
    result_queue = multiprocessing.Queue()

    # Create multiple processes
    processes = []
    for i in range(5):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(i, result_queue))
        processes.append(process)
    
    # Start all processes
    for process in processes:
        process.start()
    
    # Wait for all processes to finish
    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    # Retrieve and print all results from the queue
    while not result_queue.empty():
        print(result_queue.get())

    print("All tasks are completed.")

Output:
Task 0 is startingTask 1 is startingTask 2 is starting


Task 4 is startingTask 3 is starting

Task 0 is completed
Task 1 is completedTask 2 is completed

Task 4 is completedTask 3 is completed

Task 0 result
Task 1 result
Task 2 result
Task 4 result
Task 3 result
All tasks are completed.

Explanation of Process Communication Pattern:
==============================================

i- Queue:
A multiprocessing.Queue() is used to exchange data between processes. Each worker process puts its result into the queue using queue.put().

ii- Worker function:
The worker() function performs some work and then sends the result back to the parent process using the shared Queue.

iii- Main process:
The main process starts all child processes and waits for them to finish using join(). After that, it retrieves the results from the queue and prints them.


3. Process Pool Pattern
========================
If you need to run a large number of processes but want to limit how many run concurrently, you can use a process pool. The Pool class allows you to create a pool of worker processes to which tasks can be submitted.

Example:
import multiprocessing

# Define a function to be executed by the pool
def square(number):
    return number * number

if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    # Create a Pool of 2 worker processes
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=2)
    
    # Map the square function to the list of numbers
    results = pool.map(square, numbers)

    # Close the pool and wait for the worker processes to finish
    pool.close()
    pool.join()

    print(f"Results: {results}")

Output:
Results: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Explanation of Process Pool Pattern:
====================================

i- Pool:
- The Pool class is used to create a pool of worker processes that can be used to execute a function multiple times in parallel.
- map() is used to distribute the tasks (in this case, squaring numbers) across the worker processes.

ii- Concurrent execution:
In this example, only 2 processes are active at a time due to processes=2, ensuring limited resource consumption while still leveraging parallelism.



4. Advantages and Disadvantages
================================

Advantages:
===========
i- True Parallelism: Processes run independently and can execute in parallel on multiple CPU cores, enabling true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks (unlike threading in Python, which is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock).

ii- Isolation: Processes have separate memory spaces, reducing the risk of data corruption and allowing for greater stability and security in critical applications.

iii- Better CPU Utilization: Process-based multitasking allows better use of multi-core CPUs, making it suitable for compute-intensive tasks.

Disadvantages:
==============

i- Heavyweight: Processes are more resource-intensive than threads since each process has its own memory space, file descriptors, and operating system overhead.

ii- Complexity: Communication between processes can be more complex than threads since processes do not share memory. You need to use IPC mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory.

iii- Slower Process Creation: Creating processes takes more time and system resources compared to threads.

iv- Cross-platform Issues: The behavior of process-based multitasking can vary slightly between operating systems (e.g., Windows vs. Unix-like systems), making it important to test thoroughly across different platforms.


5. Use Case for Process-Based Multitasking
===========================================
i- Parallel Processing for CPU-bound Tasks: 
Process-based multitasking is ideal for CPU-bound tasks, like data processing, simulations, and rendering where each process can take advantage of multiple CPU cores.

Example: A scientific application that runs complex simulations can divide the workload across multiple processes to run calculations in parallel on different CPU cores.
